        <h2 class="titles teq-titles">Description</h2>
        <p>Tequeños are Venezuelan bread sticks that consist of queso blanco (fresh cheese) in the middle, and are fried till they become crispy. A popular meal or snack in Venezuela, they can be eaten for breakfast, as a side appetizer or as a snack food. </p>
        <p>They are also commonly served at parties and weddings.</p>

        <h2 class="titles teq-titles">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for rolling)</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons room temperature water (plus more as needed)</li>
            <li>8 ounces queso blanco, queso de freir, or halloumi cheese</li>
            <li>4 cups neutral oil, such as rapeseed or vegetable, for deep frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="titles teq-titles">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour and salt in the workbowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade; pulse to combine. Sprinkle butter evenly over flour and pulse until butter is cut into pieces slightly smaller than a pea, about 8 one-second pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add in egg and water. Using a rubber spatula, press dough against side of bowl until it forms into a ball. If dough is not fully forming, add additional water one tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Press dough into a disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Unwrap dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a square 1/8-inch thick. Cut off edges to create a 12-inch square. Cut square into strips 3/4-inch wide.</li>
            <li>Take one strip of dough and drape end over top of one cheese slice. Wrap entire cheese slice in dough on a diagonal, overlapping dough. Cover bottom of cheese slice in dough and pinch edges close to fully seal. Repeat with remaining cheese slices.</li>
            <li>Fill a cast iron skillet with 3/4-inch of oil. Heat oil to 400°F (204°C) over high heat. Place tequeños in oil and fry until crust is golden brown and blistery, 3 to 5 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer tequeños to a paper towel-lined plate, let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
